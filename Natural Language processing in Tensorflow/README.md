## Course 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

In this third course, you’ll learn how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it’s recognizable by a neural network. You’ll be introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how you can train them to understand the meaning of text. Finally, you’ll learn how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!
